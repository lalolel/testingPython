''' Create a function named count_first_letter that takes a dictionary named names as a parameter. names should be a dictionary where the key is a last name and the value is a list of first names. For example, the dictionary might look like this:

The function should return a new dictionary where each key is the first letter of a last name, and the value is the number of people whose last name begins with that letter.
